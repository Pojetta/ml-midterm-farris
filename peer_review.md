Review one other GitHub repository and provide feedback on:

Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
Submission: Submit a short peer review document in your own repository titled peer_review.md.
The peer review must contain a clickable Markdown link to the notebook (.ipynb) file reviewed along with your personal, well-organized and presented 4-pont review. Provide specifics - both positive and constructive feedback. Suggest improvements where possible and explain why a different choice might be useful as well. Focus on actionable suggestions that the author could realistically implement.
