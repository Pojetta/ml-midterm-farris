# 💸 Banknote Authentication — Machine Learning Midterm  

Welcome to the documentation for my **Banknote Authentication Classification Project**, where machine learning models are used to distinguish between **authentic** and **forged** banknotes using engineered numerical features derived from wavelet-transformed images.

This project walks through the full machine learning workflow — from exploring the dataset, to modeling, evaluating, and visualizing results.

## 🔍 What This Project Covers  

### **✔ Dataset Exploration**  
Understanding the four statistical features extracted from banknote images:  
- Variance  
- Skewness  
- Kurtosis  
- Entropy  

### **✔ Visualizations**  
Histograms, boxplots, and a fully customized color-coded Decision Tree.

### **✔ Modeling**  
Two classification models are implemented and compared:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  

### **✔ Results & Insights**  
The dataset is highly separable, allowing Logistic Regression to achieve perfect accuracy.

## 🚀 Goal of the Project  
To demonstrate a complete and interpretable machine learning workflow using a clean, numerical dataset — from feature understanding to model evaluation — with results that clearly show how engineered features can effectively separate classes.

## 📚 Next Steps  
Future extensions may include SVM, Random Forest, cross-validation, or deeper feature importance analysis.
